# Metagene-Projection
Over the summer of 2018, I worked on with Dr. Qingrun Zhang and the University of Calgary's bioinformatics department to evaluate the efficacy of existing cross-platform, cross-species and cross-tissues algorithms that evaluate genetic similarity.
This project stores modified code from Tamayo et. al. regarding metagene projection, a cross-species method that utilized non-negative matrix factorization.

## Tools:
* R: used for data wrangling, matrix factoring, pseudoinverse projections, model construction and visualizations
* Linux: converted hundreds of .txt files to .GCT and .CLS files.

## Methods used:
* Non-negative matrix factorization
* Pseudoinverses
* Hierarchical clustering
* Support vector machine
